Introduction: 
Ascidians play an important role in the invertebrate ecology of California aquatic ecosystems. In addition, they have a great contribution in medical science. Bays are full of nonindigenous and some native ascidians that are under investigation to learn their existence. The central coast of California remains understudied since it has been dominated by native species, although the problematic invasive didemnid is threatening to escape from San Francisco Bay to the outer coast at this time (Nydam etl al. 2022). It is significant to identify in this region which species are present on the outer coast, and to update taxonomic analyses with additional reproductive characters, habitat and distributional characters, and molecular information. The ascidians species have a similar colony and zooid outlook, which is why it can be challenging to distinguish them by using identification keys which nearly provided an ambiguous result.  The present proposal describes the project that I wish to undertake in order to contribute to finding a solution to these problem statements: to examines the morphological and reproductive patterns of ascidian species for identifying distinguishing characteristics. While the distribution of outer bay species plays a significant role in shaping these characteristics, influencing species composition and adaptation as well as an extensive analysis will determine which ascidian species inhabit the outer coast and establish the morphological traits used for their identification, comparing findings with existing reports.

By following the Smithsonian dataset card format. Include:

Dataset Card: Phylogenetic Tree Project

Title:
Phylogenetic Tree of Gene Sequences from National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)

Description:
This dataset contains gene sequence data (nucleotide) obtained from the (NCBI) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/?term=Ascidian) in FASTA format and a corresponding Nexus file used for generating phylogenetic trees. The purpose of this project is to construct and analyze phylogenetic relationships among Ascidian species using sequence data.

Source:
Data retrieved from: NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information)

File Formats: .fasta for gene sequences, .nexus for phylogenetic tree generation

sequences.fasta: Contains around 600bais pairs (bp) gene sequences different tunicate species (demo species collected: source: https://seanet.stanford.edu/Urochordata) in FASTA format.

tree_data.nexus: Contains phylogenetic tree generation information.

Usage: Analysis goals (phylogenetic tree construction).

Limitations: Biases or limitations (e.g., incomplete gene sequences).
